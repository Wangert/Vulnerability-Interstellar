QmTusqRQcFRFsaqqPWBUvNpreZpiPCMnZdnG4M4qGKDnFT=EthereumTD@@@joten@@@2019-10-02 04\:01\:58@@@not fix@@@1.Some smart contracts use block timestamps as a starting point for certain operations.\n2.When other nodes receive a new block, a miner can make a profit by setting the block's timestamp, simply by verifying that the timestamp is later than the previous block and within 900 seconds of the local time.@@@0@@@58@@@1

QmTuSjAM7wdpAmWDrTABWgguwUfCXPfmYnRLvDiTCBj5w9=vulnerabilityGGG@@@joten@@@2019-09-28 08\:23\:21@@@not fix@@@1.An attacker deduces or guesses the session credentials, hijacks the user session or impersonates the user to gain unauthorized access. For example, when sending cookies to the user, the user may use this information to guess the session ID.\n2.Web applications receive untrusted data to identify target Web pages when redirected to other Web pages and sites, and attackers can redirect users to phishing or malicious sites, or access unauthorized Web pages.@@@0@@@0@@@1

QmWTRHrodaG2v39Myai65Se9XWgtocc371aXnj2CntnxAF=publicChain_vul@@@joten@@@2019-10-03 04\:45\:42@@@not fix@@@Because the implementation code for the file upload function does not strictly restrict the file suffixes and file types that users upload, it allows an attacker to upload any PHP file to a web-accessible directory and be able to pass these files to the PHP interpreter.\n@@@0@@@0@@@0

Specifically, web applications fail to effectively execute authorization check due to unreasonable user account design or failure of server side to conduct authorization check.@@@0@@@0@@@0

QmVq8ZMTadJB6FTKDErZtKKMhT8WamtStmmB4W2HTWE28G=vulnerabilityOfWangert@@@joten@@@2019-10-03 07\:40\:14@@@not fix@@@1. When a smart contract is called, the fallback function will be called if the specified function cannot be found or is not specified at all (such as sending ether coin). Hackers can use the fallback function to do a lot of harm to the system.\n2. There is a serious recursive call vulnerability in the withdrawal code of the user, who can easily withdraw all the ether COINS from your account.\n3. In those smart contracts that have been completed or closed, although their code and global variables are clear, some of them are still executing. The will contract, like the greed contract, was caused by an ethereum error and is not currently available to hackers.\n@@@0@@@0@@@0
